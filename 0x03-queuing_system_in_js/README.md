# Queuing System in JS

This project covers the setup and usage of a Redis server, a Redis client in Node.js, and the implementation of a basic Express app interacting with both Redis and a queue system.

## 1. Install a Redis Instance

### Download and Compile Redis

```bash
$ wget http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-6.0.10.tar.gz
$ tar xzf redis-6.0.10.tar.gz
$ cd redis-6.0.10
$ make
## Start Redis Server
```
$ src/redis-server &
## Verify Server
```bash
$ src/redis-cli ping
## Set and Get Values
``` 
$ src/redis-cli
127.0.0.1:[Port]> set Holberton School
OK
127.0.0.1:[Port]> get Holberton
"School"
## Kill Redis Server
```bash
$ kill [PID_OF_Redis_Server]
Copy dump.rdb
Copy the dump.rdb from the redis-5.0.7 directory into the root of the Queuing project.

Running get Holberton in the client should return "School".

## 2. Node Redis Client
Install node_redis
```bash
Copy code
$ npm install
Run Redis Client Script
bash
## Copy code
```bash
$ npm run dev 0-redis_client.js
The script 0-redis_client.js connects to the Redis server and logs a success message if the connection is established, and an error message if not.

3. Express App with Redis
TBD

4. Express App with Redis and Queue
TBD

## 5. Requirements
Ubuntu 18.04
Node 12.x
Redis 5.0.7
## 6. Files
package.json
.babelrc
0-redis_client.js (and other scripts)
README.md

A queuing system is a mechanism that enables the efficient management and distribution of tasks or messages within a software application. In the context of Node.js and Redis, a queuing system is often used to handle asynchronous and background processing tasks.

## Here's a beautiful explanation:

Imagine your application is a bustling restaurant, and the chef (your server) is busy preparing delicious dishes (processing tasks). Now, instead of making customers (user requests) wait for the chef to finish cooking each dish before taking the next order, you introduce a sophisticated waiter (Redis) and a smart order queue (Node.js).

## Smart Order Queue (Node.js):

Customers (user requests) place their orders (tasks) with the waiter (Node.js).
The waiter efficiently takes note of each order without making the customers wait.
Customers are free to enjoy their time without being blocked by the cooking process.
Waiter's Notebook (Redis):

The waiter (Node.js) writes down each order in a special notebook (Redis).
The notebook (Redis) ensures that even if the waiter (Node.js) is busy, the orders are securely stored for future reference.
Chef (Your Server):

The chef (your server) focuses on cooking each dish (processing tasks) without interruption.
The chef (your server) periodically checks the waiter's notebook (Redis) for new orders (tasks).
Efficient Service:

As the chef completes each dish (processing task), the waiter (Node.js) serves it to the customer (completes the task).
The process continues seamlessly, providing an efficient and responsive dining experience (application performance).
This beautiful analogy illustrates the harmony between Node.js (the waiter) and Redis (the notebook) in managing tasks efficiently, allowing your application to handle multiple requests without slowing down. The queuing system ensures that tasks are processed in an orderly fashion, maintaining the responsiveness and overall performance of your application.
